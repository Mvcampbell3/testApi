# testApi
Backup for work on project 1


The Claifai API we are using works really well. We are going to be able to:
- Set pictures to a storage, save their information to a database,
- Load those pictures into the Claifai cloud
- take the files from the user, store them the same way we store our files
- run a search on the files in Clarifai against the files the user adds
- We will get a value for each picture compared to all the files in the cloud for how close they are.


Early Tests look really good, I am going to be messing around with different pictures.

I added this repo because I didn't want to mess with the project repo until we are all together.
